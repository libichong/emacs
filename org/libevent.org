Since CMake can not find your OpenSSL lib and include directory,
you will have to manually tell him where they are with its command
line when you call it. Use the option -D to set constants in CMake
from the command line. You will need to set the constants OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR
and OPENSSL_LIBRARIES since they are the one triggering the error.
